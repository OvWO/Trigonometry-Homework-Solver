# Trigonometry-Homework-Solver #

Our teacher assigned us to solve many pages of long math problems. **We spent about 2 minutes** typing all the numbers to get the values of six trigonometric functions and then use one of those values to know the value of an angle in Degrees, Minutes and Seconds format. So I decided to make life easier by doing a python script. The final result was **a program that cut down that time to 5 seconds ðŸ˜Ž.**

![Python script that solves trigonometric Exercises](https://github.com/OvWO/Trigonometry-Homework-Solver/blob/master/img/trigonometry.png)

It was originally written in Spanish but I made an english version in which I also commented the code. The reason itâ€™s originally in Spanish is because I wanted to teach some of my friends how to code and it would be easier to do it in Spanish. 

Yes, I made some mistakes. If were to start this from scratch I would:

- Choose diferent variable and function names.
- Use a different method to choose a language.
- Use Object Oriented Programming development structure. 

I also wanted to make another script for our next assignment but it didnâ€™t turned out well. i ran out of time mainly because I got confused with variable names and when I was debugging it threw out false positives. 

## Running the script: ##

For Mac OS and linux:
1. Copy this repo with git command or download and extract the zip file (green button).
2. Navigate to the code folder under Trigonometry-Homework-Solver-master folder.
3. Run it with python.

``` 
git clone https://github.com/OvWO/Trigonometry-Homework-Solver.git
cd Trigonometry-Homework-Solver/code/
python english_trigonometry.py
```

For Windows (64-bit Only)
1. Copy this repo with git command or download and extract the zip file (green button).
2. Navigate to the Windows folder. 
3. Run func.exe by double clicking it or typing func.exe in the command line. An alert message should appear but you could just skip it and continue with the program or Download python for windows and follow the same steps for Mac OS and Linux.

NOTE: The other files under the Windows folder are required to run the script properly using func.exe
